/**
 * Schema analysis for the sync engine.
 *
 * The engine never reads a database and never imports Strapi. It is handed
 * plain `schema.json` objects - the same files `api/core`'s registry loads
 * - and answers three questions about them:
 *
 *   1. which attributes are scalars, relations, media, components, zones;
 *   2. which side of a bidirectional relation *owns* the link;
 *   3. given a set of in-scope types, what does that set fail to reach.
 *
 * (2) is the one that matters. `strapi-content-sync-pro` got it backwards and
 * the result was that **no bidirectional relation ever synced, in either
 * direction** - menus arrived with no items, page groups with no member pages,
 * every `seo-meta` row detached (docs/todo/cms-sync/plugin-gaps.md GAP-1).
 * It is re-derived from Strapi's own source here, with the citation, so the
 * next person can check it rather than trust it.
 *
 * (3) is the answer to GAP-3. The plugin discovered out-of-scope relation
 * targets one record at a time, at write time, and failed the whole record -
 * so a single `cms-page.owners` pointing at a users-permissions user took the
 * entire page down with it. A relation's target is a property of the *schema*
 * and the *manifest*, both known before a run starts, so it is diagnosed at
 * configuration time and simply not attempted.

/**
 * The planner: two snapshots in, an ordered list of intentions out.
 *
 * Nothing here performs I/O. A plan is a plain object that can be printed,
 * diffed, approved and only then applied - which is the whole point, because
 * the failure mode this engine exists to avoid is a sync that did something
 * surprising and told you afterwards.
 *
 * Three rules are load-bearing, each of them a bug the previous plugin shipped:
 *
 * 1. **Set difference never deletes.** A record on the target that is absent
 *    from the source can mean it was deleted at source, or that the source
 *    query filtered it out, or that somebody created it directly on the
 *    target. Those are three different situations and one observation, so the
 *    planner reports them as `orphans` and acts only where a tombstone says
 *    the record genuinely died (GAP-10: the plugin's comparator turned every
 *    create into a delete whenever deletions were enabled).
 *
 * 2. **Writes and links are separate phases.** Every record is created or
 *    updated with its own fields first; relations are linked afterwards, once
 *    both ends exist. That makes reference cycles - `cms-menu-item.parent`,
 *    `cms-page ↔ cms-page-group` - a non-event rather than an ordering puzzle.
 *
 * 3. **Links replace, they do not append.** A link operation carries the
 *    complete owner-side set, so a value removed at source is removed at
 *    target (GAP-4: the plugin left the old file attached to a single-value
 *    `featured_image`, giving one field two media rows).

/**
 * Reading a side.
 *
 * The planner takes two snapshots and does not care where they came from. This
 * builds them from a live instance, and the only interesting decision it makes
 * is **what to populate**.
 *
 * That decision is load-bearing in a way that is easy to miss: the planner
 * decides a relation is already correct by comparing the source's populated
 * value against the target's. If one side is populated and the other is not,
 * every relation reads as changed and every run rewrites every link - which
 * bumps `updatedAt` on the target and, for a `lastWriteWins` type, makes it
 * look permanently newer than its own source. So both sides are read through
 * this function, with the same populate set, derived from the same scope.
 *
 * The populate set is exactly the relations the run may write: owner-side, and
 * pointing at a type in the manifest. Not `populate=*`, which drags in
 * inverse sides, out-of-scope targets and their whole payloads for nothing.

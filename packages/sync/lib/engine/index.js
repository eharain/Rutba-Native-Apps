/**
 * The sync engine, assembled.
 *
 * `planRun` is the whole read-only half: manifest + schemas + two snapshots in,
 * a complete, printable plan out. It performs no I/O, so it can be run against
 * a dry-run snapshot, shown to somebody, and applied later - the property the
 * previous plugin lacked, where the only way to find out what a run would do
 * was to let it do it.
 *
 * One engine, four consumers, by decision (docs/todo/erp2-program/README.md):
 * the offline desktop replica, CMS staging→production promotion,
 * instance↔instance copy-over, and cloning golden content into a freshly
 * provisioned tenant. They differ in manifest, not in mechanism.
